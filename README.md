Inspired by the Johns Hopkins Dashboard, and the NY Times Map Visualizations of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, 
I wanted to make my own disease tracker, that I am updating day by day.

I am utilizing the dataset from the Johns Hopkins CSSE department who are updating in realtime the dashboard.

I also have taken advantage of the US-States GEOJSON file from the leaflet tutorial.
